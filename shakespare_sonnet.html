  <h1>Shakespare Sonnet</h1>
  <div>
    <h3>Sonnet 1: From Fairest Creatures We Desire Increase</h3>
    <p>From fairest creatures we desire increase,
     <br> That thereby beauty's rose might never die,
     <br>But as the riper should by time decrease,
     <br>His tender heir mught bear his memeory:
     <br>But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,
     <br>Feed'st thy light'st flame with self-substantial fuel,
     <br>Making a famine where abundance lies,
     <br>Thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel.
     <br>Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament
     <br>And only herald to the gaudy spring,
     <br>Within thine own bud buriest thy content
     <br>And, tender churl, makest waste in niggarding.
     <br>Pity the world, or else this glutton be,
     <br>To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.
     </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3>Sonnet 2: When Forty Winters Shall Besiege Thy Brow</h3>
    <p>When forty winters shall besiege thy brow,
     <br> And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,
     <br>Thy youth's proud livery, so gazed on now,
     <br>Will be a tatter'd weed, of small worth held:
     <br>Then being ask'd where all thy beauty lies,
     <br>Where all the treasure of thy lusty days,
     <br>To say, within thine own deep-sunken eyes,
     <br>Were an all-eating shame and thriftless praise.
     <br>How much more praise deserved thy beauty's use,
     <br>If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine
     <br>Shall sum my count and make my old excuse,'
     <br>Proving his beauty by succession thine!
     <br>This were to be new made when thou art old,
     <br>And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.
     </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3>Sonnet 3: Look In Thy Glass, And Tell The Face Thous Viewest</h3>
    <p>Look in thy glass, and tell the face thou viewest
      <br>Now is the time that face should form another;
      <br>Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,
      <br>Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.
      <br>For where is she so fair whose unear'd womb
      <br>Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?
      <br>Or who is he so fond will be the tomb
      <br>Of his self-love, to stop posterity?
      <br>Thou art thy mother's glass, and she in thee
      <br>Calls back the lovely April of her prime:
      <br>So thou through windows of thine age shall see
      <br>Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.
      <br>But if thou live, remember'd not to be,
      <br>Die single, and thine image dies with thee.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3>Sonnet 4: Unthrifty Loveliness, Why Dost Thou Spend</h3>
    <p>Unthrifty loveliness, why dost thou spend
      <br>Upon thyself thy beauty's legacy?
      <br>Nature's bequest gives nothing but doth lend,
      <br>And being frank she lends to those are free.
      <br>Then, beauteous niggard, why dost thou abuse
      <br>The bounteous largess given thee to give?
      <br>Profitless usurer, why dost thou use
      <br>So great a sum of sums, yet canst not live?
      <br>For having traffic with thyself alone,
      <br>Thou of thyself thy sweet self dost deceive.
      <br>Then how, when nature calls thee to be gone,
      <br>What acceptable audit canst thou leave?
      <br>Thy unused beauty must be tomb'd with thee,
      <br>Which, used, lives th' executor to be.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3>Sonnet 5: Those Hours, That With Gentle Work Did Frame</h3>
    <p>Those hours, that with gentle work did frame
      <br>The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell,
      <br>Will play the tyrants to the very same
      <br>And that unfair which fairly doth excel;
      <br>For never-resting time leads summer on
      <br>To hideous winter, and confounds him there;
      <br>Sap checked with frost, and lusty leaves quite gone,
      <br>Beauty o'er-snowed and bareness every where:
      <br>Then were not summer's distillation left,
      <br>A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,
      <br>Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft,
      <br>Nor it, nor no remembrance what it was:
      <br>But flowers distill'd, though they with winter meet,
      <br>Leese but their show; their substance still lives sweet.
